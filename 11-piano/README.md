## 🎯 Lessons Learned  
- Use max-width with width: 100% to create fluid, responsive containers.  
- Replace repeated fixed widths with relative or responsive units to simplify media queries.  
- clamp() is a useful tool for setting scalable element sizes (logo, etc.).  
- Keep markup semantic and CSS modular for easier maintenance and responsiveness.
